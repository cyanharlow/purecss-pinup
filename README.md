# Pure CSS Pinup

An ongoing series in which I create art using only CSS and HTML.

Rules I have for myself:

1. All elements must be typed out by hand
2. Only a text editor and Chrome Developer Tools allowed.
3. No SVG

Because of the artistic nature of this project I have not concerned myself with cross-browser-compatibility, so the live preview will most likely look laughable in anything other than Chrome.
